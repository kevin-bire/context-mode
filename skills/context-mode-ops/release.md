# Release Workflow

## Trigger

User says: "release", "version bump", "npm publish", "ship it"

## Pre-Flight Checks

Before ANY release action, verify:

```bash
# Must be on main branch
git branch --show-current  # expect: main

# Must be clean
git status --porcelain  # expect: empty

# Must be up to date
git pull origin main
```

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Validate Codebase (Parallel Agents)

Spawn these agents simultaneously:

| Agent | Task |
|-------|------|
| **QA Engineer** | Run `npm test` + `npm run typecheck` — report full pass/fail |
| **Security Engineer** | Check for any open security issues, audit recent changes |
| **Release Engineer** | Check current version, changelog, unreleased commits |
| **DX Engineer** | Verify README is current, install instructions work |

All must report PASS before proceeding.

### 2. Version Bump

```bash
# This triggers the "version" npm lifecycle hook which runs version-sync.mjs
# version-sync updates ALL manifest files:
#   - .claude-plugin/plugin.json
#   - .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
#   - .openclaw-plugin/openclaw.plugin.json
#   - .openclaw-plugin/package.json
#   - openclaw.plugin.json
#   - .pi/extensions/context-mode/package.json
npm version patch
```

**What happens under the hood:**
1. `npm version patch` bumps `package.json` version (e.g., 1.0.54 → 1.0.55)
2. The `version` lifecycle script runs `scripts/version-sync.mjs`
3. `version-sync.mjs` syncs the new version to all 6 manifest files
4. The `version` script stages the manifest files
5. npm creates a git commit and tag

### 3. Build & Verify

```bash
# Full build (TypeScript compile + esbuild bundles)
npm run build

# Verify build artifacts exist
ls -la server.bundle.mjs cli.bundle.mjs hooks/

# Run tests against built output
npm test

# TypeScript check
npm run typecheck
```

### 4. Git Tag & GitHub Release

```bash
# The npm version command already created a git tag
# Verify it exists:
git tag --list 'v*' | tail -5

# Push the commit and tag
git push origin main --tags

# Create GitHub release with auto-generated changelog
gh release create v{VERSION} \
  --title "v{VERSION}" \
  --generate-notes \
  --latest
```

### 5. npm Publish (Local)

**⚠️ REQUIRES USER APPROVAL — ask before running.**

```bash
# Dry run first
npm publish --dry-run

# If dry run looks good, publish
npm publish
```

Verify publication:
```bash
npm view context-mode version  # should show new version
```

### 6. Sync Branches

Sync `next` with `main` to ensure next has all release changes:

```bash
# Fetch latest
git fetch origin

# Merge main into next
git checkout next
git pull origin next
git merge main --no-edit

# Push
git push origin next

# Return to main
git checkout main
```

**If merge conflict:** Resolve in favor of `main` (release branch is authoritative).

### 7. Clean Remote Branches

**⚠️ REQUIRES USER APPROVAL for EACH branch.**

List stale remote branches (everything except `main` and `next`):

```bash
# List remote branches excluding main and next
git branch -r | grep -v 'origin/main' | grep -v 'origin/next' | grep -v 'origin/HEAD'
```

For each branch, ask the user:
```
Remote branch: origin/{branch-name}
Last commit: {date} — {message}
Related PR: #{number} ({state})

Delete this branch? [y/n]
```

Only delete after explicit approval:
```bash
git push origin --delete {branch-name}
```

## Release Checklist (EM Verification)

Before declaring release complete:

- [ ] `npm test` — all pass
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` — no errors
- [ ] `npm version patch` — version bumped in all manifests
- [ ] `npm run build` — bundles generated
- [ ] `git push origin main --tags` — pushed with tag
- [ ] `gh release create` — GitHub release published
- [ ] `npm publish` — package on npm registry
- [ ] `next` branch synced with `main`
- [ ] Stale remote branches cleaned (user approved)
- [ ] Verify: `npm view context-mode version` shows new version

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong after publish:

```bash
# Unpublish within 72 hours (npm policy)
npm unpublish context-mode@{BAD_VERSION}

# Or deprecate
npm deprecate context-mode@{BAD_VERSION} "Known issue: {description}"

# Revert git
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Post-Release

After successful release:

1. Comment on all issues fixed in this release:
   ```
   Released in v{VERSION}! Please update and test:
   npm update -g context-mode
   ```

2. Update Discord if there are noteworthy changes

3. Check npm download stats in 24h for any anomalies
